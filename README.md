# SALICON API

[SALICON](http://salicon.net) is a large saliency dataset based on the [MS COCO](http://mscoco.org) image dataset. This package provides Python APIs that assists in loading, parsing and visualizing the saliency annotations in SALICON. Please visit http://salicon.net/ for more information including the data, paper, tutorials, and the exact format of the annotations. The code and data format follows the [COCO API](https://github.com/pdollar/coco). Please also refer to http://mscoco.org/ for other types of annotations.

In addition to this API, please download both the images (a subset of COCO images) and annotations in order to run the demos and use the API. Both are available on the SALICON website.
* Please download, unzip, and place the images in: `./images/`
* Please download and place the annotations in: `./annotations/`

Note that the Python API includes code (`python setup.py install`) to automatically download the data.
After downloading the images and annotations run the Python demo for example usage.
